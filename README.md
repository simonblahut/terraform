In the first project, I have put together a modular Docker deployment of a full-fledged IoT weather dashboard that utilises NodeRED, InfluxDB, and Grafana to display weather at multiple locations.

The second project has given me chance to build a K3s (A lighter distribution of Kubernetes distributed by Rancher aimed at IoT workloads) deployment on AWS. I also got my hands on working with Terraform provisioners, workspaces and remote state backend management.
